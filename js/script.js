/* 

Create two separate if statements below the variables. You will need to add decision making to this function:
Use an if statement to check if the citation property exists, and if it does, concatenate a <span></span> element, appropriate className, and citation property to the HTML string
* If the random quote object has a citation property, concatenate a <span> element with the class "citation" to the HTML string.

 Use an if statement to check of the year property exists, and if it does, concatenate a <span></span> element, appropriate className, and year property to the HTML 
 If the random quote object has a year property, concatenate a <span> element with the class "year" to the HTML string.
 
 After the two if statements, concatenate the closing </p> tag to the HTML string
set the innerHTML of the quote-box div to equal the complete HTML string*/ 


if () {

};


 

/*Use the following code snippet as a guide for what the HTML string should look like with the added "citation" and "year" <span> elements 
(like earlier, omit the second closing </p> tag for now):


<p class="quote"> A random quote </p>
<p class="source"> quote source
  <span class="citation"> quote citation </span>
  <span class="year"> quote year </span>
</p>

Below the if statements, complete the string by concatenating a closing </p> tag to the HTML string.
 This is the closing tag for the second paragraph with the class source.

Lastly, set the printQuote function to return the full HTML string displaying a random quote.
